# housePricePredictionCode

  ML project to predict the price of houses in a particular locality.

I was given a dataset containing details about the locality like crime rate, age of the house,distance from neighbouring employement facility,etc, and from that data i trained my model to predict the House price.

I used 80% of my data to train thr model and rest 20% to test the model to check the accuracy of the model.
I trained my model using linear regression.

In this project i worked on data in which i finded correlations,plotting graphs, created a pipeline, dealt with missing values and much more.

In the end i present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features.
